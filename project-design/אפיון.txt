for the front end modules the cards are in form of "4-C" (this would be the 4 of clubs)
the backend function should be prepared to accept the cards in this format and also return it in this format


backend functions:
 - build deck
 - deal card and remove that card from the deck
 - calculate the sum of the hand
 - 








what does a players turn include?
    1. player has option to hit or stay 
    2a. player hits => function receives players hand, appends random card to hand and returns hand
    3a. calculate the players hand - automatic lose if over 21 otherwise back to 1 => function receives hand and returns 
    2b. player stays - calculate hand and move to dealers turn

dealers turn:
    1. calculate dealers hand and calculate the players hand - which one is higher value?
    2a. players hand is higher value so the dealer hits
    3a. players hand is still higher value so back to 2a - otherwise end here
    2b. dealers hand is higher value so end here
